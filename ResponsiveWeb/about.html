            About Tale of Wolf
          </h1>
          <p>
            Despite the series name, the books aren't actually about wolves, but instead, the Wolf is a majorly symbolic part of the stories. Tale of Wolf takes many symbolic sterotypes and concepts and puts them into the context of a war.
            Jewl's, which is often refered to as the 'Land of Riches' is known to be the most peaceful planet in the Twenty-One Worlds being the cheif of scientific discovery and progress. On the surface, it is a uptopia. But many things give hints that it actually isn't.

            <br><strong>First:</strong> The incorpation of colors. Green, the color of deception, is worn by the main villian of the series, who at first glance is a kind woman who only wants peace and prosperity for human kind. However, looking deeper into her story, you realize her means of keeping peace often calls for sacrifices that begs the question, 'Is it worth it?'
            <br><strong>Second:</strong> They are too perfect. From the outside, their system works like clockwork. However, looking deeper into their politics and noticing how terrible their life styles and traditions actually are, it paints a dark picture of what Jew'ls really is. Wolfal's story becomes something of a dangerous topic as it's brought to light.
            <br><strong>Third:</strong> The names. People on Jew'ls are named for animals that their parents expect them to be like. In Wolfal's case, she's meant to grow into someone loyal and strong. On the other hand, her name is a double edged sword. She can be loyal, but even a wolf will dress in sheep's clothing to win a war.
